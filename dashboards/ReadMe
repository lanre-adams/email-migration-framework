â€‹Creating a Power BI report programmatically is a complex task due to the proprietary nature of the .pbix file format. 
Currently, there is no officially supported method to generate .pbix files entirely through code. However, 
Microsoft has introduced the Power BI Project (.pbip) format, which allows for version control and collaborative development of Power BI reports.
This format separates the report and dataset definitions into individual files, making it easier to manage and modify them programmatically.
