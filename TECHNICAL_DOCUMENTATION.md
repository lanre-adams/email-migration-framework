# 🧾 Technical Documentation: Email Migration Automation Framework

## 🔍 Overview
This PowerShell framework automates the migration of critical communications for over 5,000 staff across 42 educational facilities. It handles ~8TB of historical email data with integrity, security, and efficiency, ensuring minimal operational disruption and maximum reliability.

## 🏛️ Architectural Principles

### 1. **Pre-Migration Intelligence**
Before initiating migration, the system performs a detailed environment scan to detect corrupted items, configuration issues, or policy violations.

### 2. **Adaptive Execution**
Migration behavior is dynamically adapted based on message size, attachment structure, and mailbox characteristics using conditional logic.

### 3. **Self-Healing Resilience**
Retry logic and a watchdog process ensure continuous operation even during failures, allowing unattended night/weekend runs.

### 4. **Auditable Transparency**
All migration steps are logged, timestamped, and formatted for Power BI dashboards and compliance reports.

## ⚙️ Modules

### 🔍 Analyze-MailboxEnvironment.ps1
- Collects size, item count, last login, and corruption indicators.
- Outputs CSV for planning and prioritization.

### 🚀 Invoke-SmartMigration.ps1
- Uses mailbox metadata to adjust migration batch sizes and throttle settings dynamically.
- Supports parallel migrations using `ThreadJob`.

### 🔁 Invoke-MigrationWithRetry.ps1
- Implements retry with exponential backoff.
- Captures detailed error diagnostics.
- Escalates only when retries fail.

### 📋 Log-MigrationResult.ps1
- Appends migration results (status, duration, retries) into a centralized CSV.
- Structured for Power BI import.

### 🛡️ Monitor-MigrationWatchdog.ps1
- Detects hung or failed migrations and triggers automated restarts or requeues.

## 📊 Reporting

### Dashboard: `migration_dashboard.pbix`
- Migration progress and status
- Retry analytics
- Mailbox throughput
- Facility-wise breakdown

## 🚀 Deployment

1. Extract or clone the repo.
2. Run `installer.ps1` to configure modules and environment prerequisites.
3. Set execution policies and register scheduler tasks.
4. Monitor logs and dashboards from the `data` folder and Power BI.
